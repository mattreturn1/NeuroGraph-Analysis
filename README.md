## Installation of the dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Francescus02/LFN-Project
```

2. Download the library required

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. The repository contains the already filtered folders.  
   If you want to test the `folders_organizer.py`, you need to download `abide.zip` and `ppmi_v2.zip` from the following link:

[https://auckland.figshare.com/articles/dataset/NeurIPS_2022_Datasets/21397377](https://auckland.figshare.com/articles/dataset/NeurIPS_2022_Datasets/21397377)

Then extract the contents of the `abide.zip` folder and rename the extracted folder to `abide`.  
Similarly, extract the contents of the `ppmi_v2.zip` folder and rename the extracted folder to `ppmi`.  
Move both renamed folders to the root folder of the project.
